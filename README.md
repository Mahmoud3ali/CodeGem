# Our Engineering Challenge ðŸ’Ž

### What weâ€™re looking for

Our goal here is better understand your technical skillset, and more importantly, how you think, problems solve and, make decisions. Weâ€™ll be walking through the challenge together, and discussing considerations, and questions.

*Please note, we value quality over quantity! If you donâ€™t have time to complete the full challenge, that is okay! Please make decisions and scope down the work as though this was a real project delivered to a customer (i.e. must-have vs. nice-to-have)*

**Getting to Know CodeGem ðŸŒ±**
    
To better understand CodeGem hereâ€™s a link to our [website](https://codegem.app) &

### The Challenge
The CodeGem browser extension is used to collect check-ins & feedback from engineers without interrupting their workflow. This template include a sample version of the extension. Your challenge is to implement the requirement ourlined below ontop of the existing codebase.

#### Must haves

- Build out the calendar UI [(See Figma file here)](https://www.figma.com/file/JVwc6KY4mrP4w8J894n54U?node-id=0:1)
    - The color of the calendar represents the average sentiment for that day.
    - Clicking on a day in the calendar should filter the list of check-ins by that day
- Add Unit tests for the following repository methods:
    - `FeedbackRepository:getTodaysCheckInsCount`
    - `FeedbackRepository:saveFeedback` (test the streak feature)
    - `FeedbackMoodRepository:saveMoodsForFeedback`

#### Nice to have

- Add tests for the following API endpoints:
    - `GET /check_in_status`
    - `POST /feedback`
- Create a simple form transition (See below link for example)

### Submission

- Please add `StephanieJoyMills` & `manan-jadhav` to the repo and send an email to hello@codegem.app with a link to your challenge along with a short video demo of the project running. Our goal is to understand your thinking process so any rough notes are welcome!
